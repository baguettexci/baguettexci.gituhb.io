As lots of unstructured data is available on the internet, the dataset used will be extracted from TripAdvisor. 
TripAdvisor is a widely known website that shows hotel and restaurant reviews, accommodation bookings and other travel-related content.
I performed a web scraping on TripAdvisor for the hotel, Marina Bay Sands, using [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)

The items to be retrieved are:
* Content of the reviews
* Ratings of the reviews
* Reviewed date
